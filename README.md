# Description

 Q-bitz is a puzzle game in which players try to recreate the patterns using cubes.
The game has several different rounds. 

# Rounds

## Race

At this round, players will be racing with each other to recreate the pattern shown on the Q-bitz card drawn to start the game by using the set of cubes that can be rotated. The race will be started when the card is shown to players. Player can submit the pattern that created to win the game. In practice mode, players will recreate the pattern with a timer on the screen. How much time they use for each card will be shown in a local scoreboard to see how they are doing.

  

## Roll to Win

All cubes are rolled and players try to recreate the pattern on the card without rotating the cubes. When the player decides the cubes that rolled cannot be used for recreating the pattern more, the cubes can be rolled again without a limitation of number of rolling. Players can submit their work to win the game.

  
## Memory

Players have 10 seconds to memorize the pattern on the Q-bitz card. Players then try to recreate the pattern from their memory with the set of cubes that can be rotated. Players who have recreated the pattern correctly, wins the round.

## Practice Mode
Players can also practice their skills in Practice Mode, by themselves and with no time limit.
